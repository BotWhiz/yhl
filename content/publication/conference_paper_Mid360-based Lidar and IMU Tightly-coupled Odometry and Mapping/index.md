abstract: |
  Based on the experimental equipment of the latest solid-state lidar Livox-Mid360, this paper explores tightly coupled SLAM method for lidar and inertial measurement unit (IMU). Aiming at the non-uniform sampling point cloud characteristics of solid-state lidar, we use a method based on single-line depth variation to extract point cloud features. Sliding windows based local map construction and submap-to-submap constraints can effectively adapt to the complex environment. The ground constraint module is added to reduce the trajectory error when the system is deployed in unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). The method proposed in this paper is feasible and effective in our different environment experiments. It can obtain higher trajectory accuracy and does not lose positioning when shaking quickly.

summary: This paper introduces a SLAM method for lidar and IMU based on Livox-Mid360, aimed at improving trajectory accuracy in complex environments and reducing error when deployed on unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs).
