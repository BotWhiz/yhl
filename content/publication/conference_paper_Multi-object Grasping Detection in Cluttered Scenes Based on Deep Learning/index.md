abstract: |
  In this paper, we mainly improved the grasp detection network based on the grasp pose detection (GPD) algorithm. Three Network in Network (NIN) structure blocks are used as feature extraction modules, and a fully connected layer is used for classification. We trained the network on our own dataset, where these 3D models are all from GraspNetAPI, and the accuracy rate on the test set is 2% higher than the original network. Moreover, the amount of its parameters has dropped by 38%. In addition, we combined the Mask R-CNN semantic segmentation network to perform target detection and pixel-level instance segmentation on target objects, enabling grasping of objects of interest. Finally, we carried out grasping experiments on real robots, and the total grasping success rate was over 70%.

summary: This paper improves grasp detection networks by reducing parameters and increasing accuracy, and combines Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation, resulting in over 70% success rate in real robot grasping experiments.
