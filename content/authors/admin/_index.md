## About Me
```markdown
In 2023, I received my Ph.D. degree in Mechatronic Engineering from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-chinese-academy-sciences-ucas) (QS ranking 63) at the [State Key Laboratory of Robotics](http://rlab.sia.cas.cn/), under the supervision of [Researcher Daokui Qu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%9B%B2%E9%81%93%E5%A5%8E/6865367?fr=ge_ala). My research interests include key technologies in autonomous motion planning for robots.

Since December 2022, I have been working as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Zhejiang Lab](https://www.zhejianglab.org/lab/home), with research interests including localization and mapping for mobile robots, autonomous navigation and exploration for robots, robot learning, and embodied intelligence.
