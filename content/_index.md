      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
      I am a robotics and AI researcher with a Ph.D. focusing on autonomous systems and human-robot interaction. My work aims to bridge the gap between cutting-edge academic research and real-world industrial applications, ensuring that the technologies developed in labs can be effectively applied in challenging environments.

      **Key Areas of Expertise:**
      - **Autonomous Systems:** My research focuses on enabling unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and mobile robots to autonomously navigate and interact in complex, dynamic environments. This includes online trajectory generation, real-time motion planning, LiDAR-based SLAM systems, and advanced obstacle detection using 3D LiDAR, particularly for obstacles that are challenging to detect with image-based methods.
      - **Human-Robot Interaction:** Ensuring safe and effective collaboration between robots and humans in shared workspaces is a central theme in my research. I have developed algorithms that enhance safety and productivity by preventing collisions and optimizing the interaction between robots and humans, even in highly dynamic environments.

      
      - **Optimization & Machine Learning:** I leverage convex optimization and deep learning techniques to improve robotic decision-making, enabling robots to make more accurate and efficient decisions in uncertain and rapidly changing conditions. My methods are designed to optimize performance while minimizing computational costs, ensuring that robots can operate autonomously with minimal human intervention.

      **Application in Industry:**
      My research has direct applications in industries such as autonomous driving, smart manufacturing, and logistics. For example, my work on LiDAR SLAM systems and obstacle detection for UGVs can be applied to autonomous vehicle navigation, while my motion planning algorithms are ideal for robotic arms in automated warehouses.

      **Collaboration and Future Research:**
      I am passionate about collaborating with industry partners to bring advanced robotics and AI solutions to market. I am actively looking to contribute my expertise to a forward-thinking team where innovation and technology drive tangible business outcomes.
